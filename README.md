"# orthoptera" 

A repository we are using for the 2016 Summer School in Å kocjan, Slovenia.
We are investigating the communication sounds of different Orthoptera species.

This repository contains a file tree, with descriptions, sound files and images of different species of Orthoptera.

The bash script species.sh compiles a nice overview from the data in the file tree.
